# main goal: create functioning game loop for basic "hangman" game.
# user has a limited number of guesses to complete a word pulled at random from a word list
# stored in a text file. implement option to play again upon game completion (win or loss).
# basic functionality ideas: print # of guesses left. restrict user input to one letter at a time. support multi-word answers.
# additional functionality ideas: ascii art or similar indicator of number of guesses left. support multiple themed word lists (chosen at start/restart)
